Importing scanner to get input

Name the class as NumberPlease and after the main method:

- Write the given grid using a 2D array
- create a scanner object

Use a for loop that will run 4 times because we need 4 sets of input
  In the for loop get the coordinates for the rectangles
  Then print the sum of the numbers in the rectangle by using calculateSum method

In the calculateSum method define the bound of the rectangle and then in the loops: 
  
  Outer Loop (i):
- The outer loop iterates through the rows (y-axis) 

Inner Loop (j):
- The inner loop iterates through the columns (x-axis)
